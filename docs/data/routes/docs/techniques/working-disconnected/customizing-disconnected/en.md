# Customizing Disconnected Data

When disconnected mode starts up, it creates a mock version of the JSS services that would run in connected mode on Sitecore.

These mock services may need to be customized to account for [server-side customizations](/docs/techniques/extending-layout-service/extending-layout-service-overview) to Layout Service, so that disconnected mode receives the same customizations.

## The Disconnected Mode Proxy

Disconnected mode starts up a local HTTP server to run the mock APIs. This is defined in the sample apps in `scripts/disconnected-mode-proxy`, and this is what will be customized when you want to alter the disconnected mode data.

The default disconnected mode proxy comes with a number of options to customize its data. The `sitecore-jss-dev-tools` package exports the `DisconnectedLayoutServiceOptions` TypeScript typing that documents the full array of options and their signatures. TS-aware editors, like VS Code, will enable reading this metadata even if the file is not TypeScript.

```js
const proxyOptions = {
  appRoot: __dirname,
  appName: config.appName,
  watchPaths: ['../data'],
  language: config.language,
  port: 3042,
  compilers: ['@babel/register'],
  ...
};
```

## Customizing the Context

When customizing the [Layout Service context](/docs/techniques/extending-layout-service/layoutservice-extending-context) on the Sitecore side, you may wish to apply similar customizations when disconnected. The `customizeContext` hook allows you to do just that:

```js
const proxyOptions = {
  appRoot: __dirname,
  customizeContext: (context, route, currentManifest, request, response) => {
    return { myCustomContextProperty: 'helloworld', ...context };
  },
  ...
};
```

## Customizing Component Data

When customizing component data using [Rendering Contents Resolvers or Integrated GraphQL](/docs/techniques/extending-layout-service/layoutservice-rendering-contents) on the Sitecore side, you may wish to apply similar customizations when disconnected. The `customizeRendering` hook allows you to do just that:

```js
const proxyOptions = {
  appRoot: __dirname,
  customizeRendering: (rendering, rawManifestRendering) => {
    // mock integrated GraphQL results for a specific component name
    if (rendering.componentName === 'ContentBlock' && rendering.fields) {
      rendering.fields = {
        data: {
          item: {
            id: 'mock-graphql-result-id',
            heading: {
              jss: rendering.fields.heading,
            }
          }
        }
      };

      return rendering;
    }

    // customize data based on a flag value added to the component definition on the route
    // i.e. in YAML, 
    // - componentName: Whatever
    //   addCoolStuff: true
    if (rawManifestRendering.dataSource.addCoolStuff) {
      return {
        coolStuff: [
          'React',
          'Vue',
        ],
        ...transformed,
      };
    }

    // returning falsy will cause JSS to use the default value
    return undefined; // is a function
  },
  ...
};
```

## Advanced Customizations

The disconnected server in sample apps defaults to using the `createDefaultDisconnectedServer()` [helper function](https://github.com/Sitecore/jss/blob/master/packages/sitecore-jss-dev-tools/src/disconnected-server/create-default-disconnected-server.ts). This function provides basic customization APIs and encapsulates the registrations of several middlewares that make the disconnected server work. You can also unpack the function and register the middleware yourself if you need to do advanced customizations that are not supported by the default `DisconnectedServerOptions`.
